The most basic Nuzlocke rules, as they were first introduced, are as follows:

    Any Pokémon that faints is considered dead, and must be released or put in the Pokémon Storage System permanently.
    The player may only catch the first Pokémon encountered in each area, and none else. If the first Pokémon encountered 
    faints or flees, there are no second chances. If the first encounter in the area is a Double Battle in dark grass, 
    the player may choose which of the two Pokémon they would like to catch. If there's a static encounter in the area, 
    the player is allowed to capture them despite already capturing a Pokémon in that area. Shiny Pokémon also do not apply
    to this rule.

Other near-universally used rules include:

    The general consensus is that players must also nickname all of their Pokémon, for the sake of forming stronger emotional
    bonds.
    The general consensus is that a black out/white out is considered to be "game over", even if there are Pokémon left in the
    PC, however it may be adjusted that other Pokémon in the PC can be used to continue, should this happen.
    Strongly implied, though not explicitly mentioned in the comic, is the stipulation that the player can use only Pokémon
    they have captured themselves, meaning traded Pokémon, mystery gifts, etc., are prohibited. Trading and retrading the 
    same Pokémon (for the purpose of evolving a Graveler, for example) is something of a gray area, and may fall under 
    optional rules. As of White: Hard-Mode Episode 3, it is implied that the player can accept Pokémon that are received
    freely from NPCs.
    Also strongly implied is a prohibition against voluntarily resetting and reloading the game when things go wrong.
    Being able to do so would render all of the other rules pointless.
